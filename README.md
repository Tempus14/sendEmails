## Quick Start - Adding New Conditions

**Want to add a birthday greeting with flexible data? Just edit `email_config.py`:**

```python
{
    'name': 'birthday_greeting',
    'column': 'Birthday',
    'trigger_values': ['TRUE', 'Today', 'This Month'], 
    'content': '''
        <p><strong>Happy Birthday, {Nickname|{Name}}!</strong></p>
        <p>Wishing you a wonderful {Age|new} year ahead!</p>
    ''',
    'description': 'Birthday greeting with nickname fallback and age',
    'is_template': True
}
```

**Templates can use ANY recipient data with fallbacks: `{Nickname|{Name}}` uses nickname if available, otherwise name!**

## Adding New Conditions - Step by Step

### Step 1: Add to `email_config.py`
```python
CONDITIONAL_CONTENT = [
    # ... existing conditions ...
    
    {
        'name': 'birthday_greeting',
        'column': 'Birthday', 
        'trigger_values': ['TRUE', 'Today', 'This Month'],
        'content': '''
            <p><strong>Happy Birthday!</strong></p>
            <p>Wishing you a wonderful year ahead!</p>
        ''',
        'description': 'Birthday greeting for recipients'
    }
]
```

### Step 2: Update Your CSV
```csv
"Name", "Mail", "Technic", "Workshop", "Birthday", "PersonalNote"
"John", "john@email.com", "FALSE", "TRUE", "TRUE", "Have a great day!"
```

### Step 3: That's It! 
The system automatically detects and applies the new condition.

## Flexible Template System

**All templates can use ANY recipient data from your CSV!**

### Template Syntax:
- **Simple**: `{ColumnName}` ‚Üí inserts the value from that CSV column
- **Fallback**: `{Nickname|{Name}}` ‚Üí uses Nickname if available, otherwise Name
- **Empty fallback**: `{Manager|}` ‚Üí uses Manager if available, otherwise empty string

### Real Examples:

```python
# Greeting with nickname fallback
DEFAULT_EMAIL_BODY_TEMPLATE = '''
    <p>Hi {Nickname|{Name}},<br>
       How are you doing in {Department|your role}?<br>
    </p>
'''

# Birthday with age and nickname
{
    'content': '''
        <p><strong>Happy Birthday, {Nickname|{Name}}!</strong></p>
        <p>Wishing you a wonderful {Age|new} year ahead!</p>
    '''
}

# Department message with manager info
{
    'content': '''
        <p>Hello {Nickname|{Name}},</p>
        <p>As part of the {Department} team{Manager|, your manager {Manager}} wanted to share...</p>
    '''
}
```

### Use Cases:
- **Nicknames**: `Hi {Nickname|{Name}}` ‚Üí "Hi Johnny" or "Hi John Doe"
- **Optional data**: `{Birthday|How are you?|Happy Birthday!}` 
- **Departments**: `Welcome to {Department|our team}`
- **Ages**: `Celebrating {Age} years!`
- **Managers**: `Your manager {Manager} says...`

## Real Example Results

**Input CSV:**
```csv
"Name", "Mail", "Technic", "Workshop", "VIP", "NewMember", "PersonalNote"
"Frodo", "frodo@shire.hobbit", "FALSE", "TRUE", "TRUE", "TRUE", "Welcome!"
```

## Setup

1. **Install required packages** (assuming you are using conda):
   ```bash
   conda run pip install pandas beautifulsoup4 python-dotenv
   ```

2. **Create credentials.env file** (you can copy the provided template):
   ```env
   SenderMail=your-email@example.com
   SenderPassword=your-password
   SenderServer=smtp.gmail.com
   SenderPort=465
   ```
**Never commit `credentials.env` to version control or upload the file together with other files in some shared cloud!!!**

3. **Prepare CSV file** with columns:
   - `Name`: Recipient's name (required)
   - `Mail`: Email address (required)
   - Any additional columns for conditions (e.g., `Technic`, `Workshop`, `VIP`, `PersonalNote`)

## Usage

### Preview Mode (Default - Safe!)
```bash
python main.py
# Shows email previews without sending anything
```

### Send Mode (Requires confirmation)
```bash
python main.py --send
# Asks for confirmation before actually sending emails
```

**The system runs in safe preview mode by default!** You must explicitly use `--send` to actually send emails.

## CSV Format

```csv
"Name", "Mail", "Nickname", "Department", "Birthday", "Age", "Technic", "VIP", "PersonalNote"
"John Doe", "john@example.com", "Johnny", "Engineering", "TRUE", "25", "TRUE", "TRUE", "Great work!"
"Jane Smith", "jane@example.com", "", "Marketing", "FALSE", "30", "FALSE", "TRUE", "Excellent campaign!"
```

**Templates can use ANY CSV column with fallbacks:** `{Nickname|{Name}}` uses nickname or falls back to name!

## Email Personalization

The system automatically:
- **Personalizes greetings** with recipient names from email templates
- **Applies all matching conditions** based on CSV data and configuration
- **Handles personal notes** as conditional content (processed and added to the mails text last)
- **Supports unlimited conditions** through the configuration file
- **Generates both HTML and plain text** versions (readable by basically all mail clients and configurations)
- **Templates are fully configurable** in `email_config.py`
