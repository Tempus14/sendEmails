# Sending personalized mails in batch

This system sends **infinitely customizable** personalized emails based on CSV data with a **one-file configuration** approach.

## Key Features

- ‚úÖ **CSV-based recipient management**: Load recipient data from CSV files  
- ‚úÖ **Test mode**: Preview emails without sending
- ‚úÖ **Personalized content**: Names, personal notes, dynamic greetings
- ‚úÖ **HTML & Plain text**: Dual-format emails for maximum compatibility
- ‚úÖ **One-File Configuration**: Add unlimited conditions by editing only `email_config.py`
- ‚úÖ **Unlimited conditional content**: Workshop participants, VIP members, new users, etc.
- ‚úÖ **Multiple conditions per recipient**: Recipients can match several conditions simultaneously
- ‚úÖ **UTF-8 support**: International character support
- ‚úÖ **Auto-detection**: System automatically finds and applies all matching conditions
- ‚úÖ **Error handling**: Graceful handling of missing columns and data issues

## Quick Setup & First Run

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
conda run pip install pandas beautifulsoup4 python-dotenv
```

### 2. Configure Email Credentials
Copy `credentials.env_template` to `credentials.env` and fill in your email settings:
```env
SenderMail=your-email@example.com
SenderPassword=your-password
SenderServer=smtp.gmail.com
SenderPort=465
```
**‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY WARNING: Never commit `credentials.env` to version control or upload it to shared cloud storage! This file contains your unencrypted email password.**

### 3. Prepare Your CSV File
Your CSV file needs at minimum these columns:
- `Name`: Recipient's name (required)
- `Mail`: Email address (required)  
- Any additional columns for conditions (e.g., `Technic`, `Workshop`, `VIP`, `PersonalNote`)

**Minimum example:**
```csv
"Name", "Mail"
"John Doe", "john@example.com"
"Jane Smith", "jane@example.com"
```

### 4. Try It Out (Safe Preview Mode)
```bash
python main.py
```
This shows you what emails would be sent **without actually sending them**. Perfect for testing!

### 5. Send Real Emails (When Ready)
```bash
python main.py --send
```
This will ask for confirmation before sending.

## üìÅ File Structure

```
sendEmails/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                        # Main script for sending emails
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ newPage.py                     # Email content generation class  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ email_config.py                # CONFIGURATION FILE - Edit this to add conditions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exampleRecipient.csv           # Sample data with multiple conditions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ credentials.env_template       # Template for email credentials
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ credentials.env                # Your email server credentials (not in repo)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                      # This file
```

**IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE:** 
- `credentials.env` contains your unencrypted email password
- **NEVER** commit it to version control (git)
- **NEVER** upload it to shared cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)
- **NEVER** share it in chat/email/messaging apps
- Keep it local to your machine only!

## How It Works - Basic Example

The system uses CSV files to manage recipients and applies conditions based on their data.

**Sample CSV (`exampleRecipient.csv`):**
```csv
"Name", "Mail", "Technic", "Workshop", "VIP", "PersonalNote"
"Frodo", "frodo@shire.hobbit", "FALSE", "TRUE", "TRUE", "Welcome to the adventure!"
"Legolas", "legolas@mirkwood.elf", "TRUE", "FALSE", "TRUE", "Great archery skills!"
```

**What happens:**
- Frodo gets: Base email + Workshop content + VIP content + Personal note
- Legolas gets: Base email + Technical content + VIP content + Personal note

The system automatically detects all matching conditions and builds personalized emails!

## What You'll See When Running

### Preview Mode (Default - Safe!)
```bash
python main.py
```
- Shows you exactly what each email will look like
- Lists all recipients and their conditions
- **No emails are sent** - perfect for testing!

### Send Mode (When You're Ready)
```bash
python main.py --send
```
- Shows the same preview
- Asks for confirmation before sending
- Only then sends the actual emails

## Advanced Customization

### Quick Example - Adding New Conditions

**Want to add a birthday greeting with flexible data? Just edit `email_config.py`:**

```python
{
    'name': 'birthday_greeting',
    'column': 'Birthday',
    'trigger_values': ['TRUE', 'Today', 'This Month'], 
    'content': '''
        <p><strong>Happy Birthday, {Nickname|{Name}}!</strong></p>
        <p>Wishing you a wonderful {Age|new} year ahead!</p>
    ''',
    'description': 'Birthday greeting with nickname fallback and age',
    'is_template': True
}
```

**Templates can use ANY recipient data with fallbacks: `{Nickname|{Name}}` uses nickname if available, otherwise name!**

## Adding New Conditions - Step by Step

### Step 1: Add to `email_config.py`
```python
CONDITIONAL_CONTENT = [
    # ... existing conditions ...
    
    {
        'name': 'birthday_greeting',
        'column': 'Birthday', 
        'trigger_values': ['TRUE', 'Today', 'This Month'],
        'content': '''
            <p><strong>Happy Birthday!</strong></p>
            <p>Wishing you a wonderful year ahead!</p>
        ''',
        'description': 'Birthday greeting for recipients'
    }
]
```

### Step 2: Update Your CSV
```csv
"Name", "Mail", "Technic", "Workshop", "Birthday", "PersonalNote"
"John", "john@email.com", "FALSE", "TRUE", "TRUE", "Have a great day!"
```

### Step 3: That's It! 
The system automatically detects and applies the new condition.

## Flexible Template System

**All templates can use ANY recipient data from your CSV!**

### Template Syntax:
- **Simple**: `{ColumnName}` ‚Üí inserts the value from that CSV column
- **Fallback**: `{Nickname|{Name}}` ‚Üí uses Nickname if available, otherwise Name
- **Empty fallback**: `{Manager|}` ‚Üí uses Manager if available, otherwise empty string

### Real Examples:

```python
# Greeting with nickname fallback
DEFAULT_EMAIL_BODY_TEMPLATE = '''
    <p>Hi {Nickname|{Name}},<br>
       How are you doing in {Department|your role}?<br>
    </p>
'''

# Birthday with age and nickname
{
    'content': '''
        <p><strong>Happy Birthday, {Nickname|{Name}}!</strong></p>
        <p>Wishing you a wonderful {Age|new} year ahead!</p>
    '''
}

# Department message with manager info
{
    'content': '''
        <p>Hello {Nickname|{Name}},</p>
        <p>As part of the {Department} team{Manager|, your manager {Manager}} wanted to share...</p>
    '''
}
```

### Use Cases:
- **Nicknames**: `Hi {Nickname|{Name}}` ‚Üí "Hi Johnny" or "Hi John Doe"
- **Optional data**: `{Birthday|How are you?|Happy Birthday!}` 
- **Departments**: `Welcome to {Department|our team}`
- **Ages**: `Celebrating {Age} years!`
- **Managers**: `Your manager {Manager} says...`

## Real Example Results

**Input CSV:**
```csv
"Name", "Mail", "Technic", "Workshop", "VIP", "NewMember", "PersonalNote"
"Frodo", "frodo@shire.hobbit", "FALSE", "TRUE", "TRUE", "TRUE", "Welcome!"
```
